1. Startup 
    -- Files\Folders get created. Seems to be working fine.

2. Requests
    -- Report(id = 0): seems to be working fine.
    -- Quit (id = 1): seems to be working fine.
    -- Track (id = 2): seems to be working fine {
        - Adds path to the json file with tracked.
        - Creates a new sessions folder for the new process. CSV files are also created, they both have valid headers.
        - Doesnt allow to add already tracked process. Err code is returned.
        - New json is written to the file like expected.
    }
    -- Untrack (id = 3): seems to be working fine {
        - Doesnt allow to delete a process that is not tracked. Returns an error if that happends.
        - Writes new json to the file like expected.  
    }
    -- Gropued_report (id = 4): seems to be working fine.
    -- Pc_time (id = 5): seems to be working fine.
    -- Report_apps_only (id = 6): seems to be working fine.
    -- Tracked_only (id = 7): seems to be working fine.
    -- Chenge_update_time ( id = 8 ) {
        - Writes passed in data to file like expected. 
        - Invalid json keys result in "Invalid command"
    }

3. Edge cases
    -- If a single current session is left after last run it gets written to overall at start up. 
    -- When process gets untracked and if it is also active, its session will get written to overall. Current csv will get reset. 
        There are couple of logic edge cases that were really well implemented. If they happend, runtime_logic_error is returned.
